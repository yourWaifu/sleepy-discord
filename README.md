# Sleepy Discord
C++ library for Discord

# Why?
Just for the novelty of using a C++ library for Discord.

# When will this be open source?
Soon™

It'll be open source as soon as I finish cleaning up the code.

#Will Updating the library break my bot?

Yes, and for now I don't plan on making 0.0 versions backwards compatable with 1.0 versions or later.
