# CMake Graphical User Interface

## Generate

 1. At near the top, click ``Browse Source..``.

 2. Go to and Select the folder with your CMakeList.txt file.

 3. Right below the Browse Source button, click the ``Browse Build..`` button.

 4. Create a new folder in the folder with your CMakeList.txt file and call it ``build``.

 5. Select the new ``build`` folder that you just created.

 6. Around the middle, click the ``Generate`` button.

 7. Select the generator you want to use. For example, if you want to use Visual Studio 2017 and compile for 64 bit Windows, use ``Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64``.

 8. Select ``Use default native compilers`` and click ``Finish``.

 9. Wait until it's done. You can tell when it says ``Generating done`` at the bottom.
